Installing and Using Jieba for Chinese Tokenization:

Downloading and Processing English Text from Project Gutenberg:

Installing and Using NLTK for Tokenization:
     To tokenize the English text into words using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit). I learnt that Tokenization is the first step in NLP. It breaks text into individual units (tokens) for further analysis.
